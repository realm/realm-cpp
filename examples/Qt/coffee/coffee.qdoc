    The coffee machine application lets you choose a type of coffee on the
    left side of the main screen. After selection, the app displays what
    the coffee blend will contain (ratio coffee/hot milk/milk foam).
    This can be modified with two sliders. When the brew has been started,
    the app shows an animated display of the brewing process, then returns
    to the start screen.

    First the start screen \c Animationflowform is displayed, showing a
    sidebar with several types of coffee, and an empty cup on the right
    screen.

    Selecting a coffee type - for example, cappuccino - triggers \c animation1
    and \c animation2 in CoffeeButton.qml.  On the right side, you will see
    the coffee blend you selected.

    It also triggers cappuccinoButton.onClicked(), which sets the default
    mix for the coffee type selected:

    \snippet demos/coffee/SideBar.qml 0

    \caption Coffee blend cappuccino

    \c sideBar.coffeeSelected() \c sets applicationFlow.state to "selection"

    If you click "Brew me a cup", choosingCoffee.brewButtonSelection.onClicked
    is triggered:

    \snippet demos/coffee/ApplicationFlow.qml 0

    On the right side of the screen, you will see two sliders, one for
    the amount of milk, and one for sugar. They will have default values,
    but can be modified by the user.

    If you click on \c Brew, \c choosingCoffee.brewButton.onClicked() is triggered,
    which displays a screen with the message "Please insert cup into tray".

    \snippet demos/coffee/ApplicationFlow.qml 2

    Clicking on \c Continue starts the brewing of the coffee type you
    selected.

    \snippet demos/coffee/ApplicationFlow.qml 1

    The brewing process is defined as follows in \c Brewing.qml:

    \snippet demos/coffee/Brewing.qml 0

    After completion, the application returns to the start screen.
